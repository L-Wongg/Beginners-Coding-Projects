# Creating a weighted exam score average

# Entering how many exams you have done
number_of_exams = int(input("Enter number of exams: "))
# print(number_of_exams)

# Entering how many credits these exams cover
total_credits = int(input("Enter how many credits these exams cover: "))
# print(total_credits)

# Begin with average of 0 and then add up the percentages from each exam
average = 0
for exam in range(number_of_exams):
    score = int(input("Enter exam score: "))
    exam_credits = int(input("Enter how many credits this exam covered: "))
    average = average + score * exam_credits / total_credits
print("Your average is", average)

# Create classification
below_60 = '3rd'
above_60 = 2.1
above_70 = '1st'
if average is below 60 it is a '3rd'
if average is above 60 it is a 2.1
if average is above 70 it is a '1st'
